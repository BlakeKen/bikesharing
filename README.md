## Summary
Overall it seems commuting hours have the highest usage with male users and subcribers being the most active users. Although male users ride the most, all genders show the same pattern. If given more time and data I would expand the analysis on the top stations to include details on how many bikes are at those stations on average  and if it is enough in comparison to the amount usually needed.
